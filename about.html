                <p>
                    When I am not working I spend my time studying various topics.
                    Recently I have been watching a lot of programming tutorials to
                    learn how to build a variety of different applications and tools.
                    I have also learned about various other interesting topics like
                    woodworking, metallurgy, cooking, and more!

                <h2>Fueled by Coffee<i class="fa fa-fw fa-coffee"></i></h2>
                <p>
                    Coffee is my one and true vice. I would never get anything done with
                    out a little bean juice. I have more coffee gear and knowledge than
                    I am willing to admit. My go to coffee beverage is a cappuccino with
                    small dash of cinnamon on top.

                <h2>A Little Obsessive<i class="fa fa-fw fa-lock"></i></h2>
                <p>
                    Once I get into something, I really get into it. I love to learn about
                    all of the nuances in a hobby or topic. I know how different compounds
                    in a steel affect the final properties of the alloy, or how different
                    joinery in woodworking should be used in different scenarios. I enjoy
                    gaining the knowledge.

                <h2>A Little Awkward<i class="fa fa-fw fa-smile-o"></i></h2>
                <p>
                    Always a bit uncomfortable and always going out of my comfort zone.
                    I thrive on the uncomfortable feeling. It means that you are growing
                    and that you're learning. Comfort zones are for the complacent. Be comfortable
                    with being uncomfortable.
