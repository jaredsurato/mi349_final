                Hello! My name is Jared Surato. I am currently a student at Michigan State University, studying computer science with focus on media and information.
                I am recently engaged to a wonderful woman, and we plan to get married next fall! I have a twin brother who also studies at Michigan State, specifically
                civil engineering. I also have an older sister. In my free time I really enjoy working on DIY projects and tinkering with different hobbies. I have built
                several pieces of simple furniture including a small coffee table, an end table and an office desk that I still use today! I enjoy using and learning about
                technology. I have built two custom computers which probably sparked my interest in computer science! I use my computer for school and work but most
                importantly I play video games with my friends. These games include first-person shooters like Battlefield, Counter Strike, and Halo! My fiancée and I have
                recently started a Dungeons and Dragons campaign which has been a fun learning curve. During the summer I love visiting our beautiful state parks and pitching
                a tent! During days when I am stuck at home our two cats, Joe and Penny keep me company.

                <h2>Always Learning <i class="fa fa-fw fa-book"></i></h2>
                <p>
                    When I am not working I spend my time studying various topics.
                    Recently I have been watching a lot of programming tutorials to
                    learn how to build a variety of different applications and tools.
                    I have also learned about various other interesting topics like
                    woodworking, metallurgy, cooking, and more!

                <h2>Lover of Coffee <i class="fa fa-fw fa-coffee"></i></h2>
                <p>
                    Coffee is my one and true vice. I would never get anything done with
                    out a little bean juice. I have more coffee gear and knowledge than
                    I am willing to admit. My go to coffee beverage is a cappuccino with
                    a small dash of cinnamon on top.

                <h2>A Little Fanatical <i class="fa fa-fw fa-lock"></i></h2>
                <p>
                    Once I get into something, I really get into it. I love to learn about
                    all of the nuances in a hobby or topic. I know how different compounds
                    in a steel affect the final properties of the alloy, or how different
                    joinery in woodworking should be used in different scenarios. I enjoy
                    gaining the knowledge.

                <p>
                    Always a bit uncomfortable and always going out of my comfort zone.
                    I thrive on the uncomfortable feeling. It means that you are growing
                    and that you are learning. Comfort zones are for the complacent. Be comfortable
                    with being uncomfortable.
