                <p>
                    In Highschool I was on both the varsity wrestling team and varsity tennis team. During highschool I also
                    held a few different jobs. My first job was at a landscaping and power washing company, shortly after I started
                    there I applied to work at Subway and got the job. I worked at Subway until I graduated highschool, when I began
                    another job at a different landscaping company. I only stayed at that landscaping company for one summer. As I started
                    my first year of college I also started as a business assistant at a small company on campus called the Institute for
                    Cyber Enabled Research (ICER). I only worked at ICER during the school year, during my summer after freshman year I started
                    working at a small construction company called Metter Construction, I would go on to work there for three summers in a row
                    working my way to the second in command. I worked at ICER for about a year and a half before I left to work at Jackson National.
                    I stayed at Jackson for about one year before returning to work at ICER. I made this decision because I enjoyed the people at ICER
                    a lot more and there was more personal interaction at ICER. During this time I was studying computer science at Michigan State
                    University. During that time I met my Fianc√©e between my freshman and sophomore year and we got engaged in early October.
