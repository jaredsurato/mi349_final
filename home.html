                <h2>What I've Done...</h2>
                <p>
                    In Highschool I was on both the varsity wrestling team and varsity tennis team. During highschool I also
                    held a few different jobs. My first job was at a landscaping and power washing company, shortly after I started
                    there I applied to work at Subway and got the job. I worked at Subway until I graduated highschool, when I began
                    another job at a different landscaping company. I only stayed at that landscaping company for one summer. As I started
                    my first year of college I also started as a business assistant at a small company on campus called the Institute for
                    Cyber Enabled Research (ICER). I only worked at ICER during the school year, during my summer after freshman year I started
                    working at a small construction company called Metter Construction, I would go on to work there for three summers in a row
                    working my way to the second in command. I worked at ICER for about a year and a half before I left to work at Jackson National.
                    I stayed at Jackson for about one year before returning to work at ICER. I made this decision because I enjoyed the people at ICER
                    a lot more and there was more personal interaction at ICER. During this time I was studying computer science at Michigan State
                    University. During the summer of 2019 I met my Fianc√©e and we got engaged in late September this year (2021).

                <h2>What I'm Doing...</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently enrolled as a full-time senior computer science student at Michigan State University. I plan on graduating in the spring of 2022, 
                    with a bachelors degree in computer science and a cognate in media and information. I am currently working for the Institute of Cyber Enabled Research
                    where I am leading the transition of the content management system for the company website. I am currently taking Algorithm Engineering, Software Engineering,
                    Web Design and Development and an Arts and Humanities class that focuses on the Ojibwe of Lake Superior. I recently interviewed with a company called Atomic Object
                    and accepted a job offer for their Accelerator Program.

                <h2>What I'm Going To Do...</h2>
                <p>
                    Because I accepted the job offer from Atomic Object I will be moving to Ann Arbor in the summer of 2022. I am looking forward to embracing the culture at Atomic Object and becoming
                    an effective and efficient software consultant. Before then I will have one last semester as a student at Michigan State University. In that semester I will be taking four course. 
                    The most important course that I will be taking is the computer science Capstone course. This course allows students to team up with an industry partner and help them to develop some
                    sort of tool or software. On top of the Capstone course I will also be taking a Mobile Application Development course, a Web Application Development course, and Introduction to Media
                    and information (which will hopefully mean I have a very stress-free last semester). I plan on getting married late in 2022, which I am very much looking forward to.
